# Cosmos DB Airports and Routes Loader

Loads a Cosmos DB Gremlin graph database with airports and routes from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html).

## Instructions
Update config file with connection information to your Cosmos DB and run it! There is a lot of data and currently the data is loaded sequentially, so it's going to take a while. Go get a coffee or lunch or something.
